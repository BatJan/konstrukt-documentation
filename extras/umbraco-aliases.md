# Umbraco Aliases

In a number of places in the Konstrukt API you are required to know the aliases of other elements such as when you are adding sections, context apps or dashboard before/after other instances. This is easy enough when it's referencing aliases of things defined in the Konstrukt config, but for existing Umbraco instances it can be hard to find them so below is documented a number of known aliases for various elements.

## Dashboard aliases

### Content

| Name | Alias |
----------------
| Getting Started | `contentIntro` |

## Content App aliases

## Section aliases
