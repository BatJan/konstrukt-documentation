# Konstrukt vs UI-O-Matic

For anyone familiar with Umbraco you may already know of the open source back office UI builder, UI-O-Matic and be wondering why you should choose Kostrukt instead. To help with that decision, we've put together the following feature matrix to compare some of their major differences.

## API

| | Konstrukt | UI-O-Matic|
| -- | -- | -- |
| Style | Fluent API | Attribute based API |
| Strongly Typed | Yes | No |
| Seperation of Concerns | Yes - Config is seperate to poco models | No - Config is combined with the poco models |
| Manage 3rd Party Models | Yes - As config is seperate to poco models, Konstrukt can manage any poco models | No - As config is attribute based, you need to have full control of poco models to add attributes to |
| Configuration Context | Config is always in the context of the poco model with Konstrukt atuomatically converting between properties and DB columns | Config switches between poco models properties and DB columns so can be confusing if you aren't aware of the context |
| Supports DI | Yes - Where types are passed to the API, the service provider is used to resolve those types allowing for dependency injection of depdendencies | No |
